Robot Render is A GUI that facilitates After Effects comp rendering automation. 

Robot Render uses the After Effects command line renderer to render a queue of After Effects compositions. It is built for After Effects compositions using an external CSV file to dynamically update fields within its compositions. Using a secondary file containing variations, it will update the base CSV file before rendering each variation.
